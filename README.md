# Sample Win32 C Sample Application

This is the skeleton of a Win32 application in the C programming language.  It is intended as as starting point for projects requiring the basic "boilerplate" to create a single document window, handle events, and display an "about" box.

***NOTE:  This is simply a conceptual work in progress!!! In paricular, it does not yet actually compile or run with any particular Win32 tool chain!!***
